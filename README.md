# main.py is the core of the project. It acts as a control panel where I tested various scenarios using the code
The other files are for search algorithm purposes only. I decided it best to test it in the program and ignore user control over it because I wanted to test Python indentation, compilation and understand both the problem and the language better. Thank you.
